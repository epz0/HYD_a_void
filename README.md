# HackYourDistrict Project - A_VOID
## A crowdsourced, AI-powered platform for traffic accident prevention and sidewalk monitoring
![a_void](https://github.com/epz0/HYD_a_void/blob/main/images/aviod.jpg?raw=true)

This repo contains code for analysing historical traffic accident data in the city of Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\
\
We used A1/A2 type accidents data that occured in 2020 sourced from [Taiwan's government open data initiative](https://data.gov.tw/en/datasets/12197).

A_VOID brings two main contributions:
### Crowdsourced Sidewalk Issues Reporting 
Sidewalks in Kaohsiung are busy, leading to challenges in pedestrian movement and leading to unsafe transportation.\
\
A_VOID allows users to report issues with the sidewalks in the city, adding images, comments and location. This helps other users to plan ahead and for policy makers to improve the infrastructure. \

### Crowdsourced & AI identification of Near Misses
Research shows that for each accident with a fatal victim or serious injury, hundreds of other incidents happen. If we can track the incidents before they become accidents we can be more proactive with road safety. \

A_VOID allows users to submit near misses and incidents that happened to them. Adding a picture, description and location. This allows policy makers to better identify areas of worry before major accidents happen. \

### [#HackYourDistrict 2024](https://www.tu.berlin/en/arte/research/projects/hackyourdistrict/hackyourdistrict-2024)
This project was developed as part of the #HackYourDistrict 2024 - Open Data and Open Tools for a Net-Zero Urban Transport conference organised by TU Berlin in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.\
**A_void was chosen as the best project of the hackathon**, by a panel of academic experts and specialists from the city's Transportation Bureau.
